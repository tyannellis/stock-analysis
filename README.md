Analyzing stocks using VBA

## Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis was to refactor existing code written to predicnt stock prices. We wanted to refactor the code to see if we could get better performance and a faster run time. 

## Results 
The original runtime for 2017 is in the following image

## Summary 
Refractoring code has many benefits including making code more readable and have better performacne. One of the major drawbacks is that it can be time consuming. In this project trefactoring code made our run time a second quciker which may seem small, but with adding more stocks this perofmance improvemnt will be more drastic.
